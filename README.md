BlooCoin Client
===============

BlooCoin is a crypto-currency like Bitcoin that uses a central server to handle all transaction, rather than using a peer-to-peer networking system.

Client
------
On the start of bloocoin your bloostamp will be created. This file contains two hashes, one that is your BlooCoin address and the other that is your personal key. Do not lose this file or all your BlooCoins will be lost.

There are a few commands prebuilt into the client shell, for a list of them run `help` after starting it.
